RandomCafeBot is a telegram bot used to get get random food combinations at Unicafe. Lacks connection to the Unicafe API so it currently just uses foods stored in the .txt files in the root dirctory.

## Setting up

To set up the bot, you need to add a .env file in the root directory, containing the line 'BOT_TOKEN=your-token-here'. Change the getBotUsername()-method to return the username of your own bot and run Main.java.
